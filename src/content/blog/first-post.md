As you read this blog and take action on what we talk about, there is a transformation that will happen for you. You will rest easier, become more relaxed, and find joy in using the internet at your finger tips. Of course, there are a lot of other things that could be creating anxiety for you, but we hope it is not the fear of being hacked. I have experienced that fearful feeling of wondering if my internet was hacked and what it will cost to fix it. See the post WHY I CARE ABOUT COMPUTER SECURITY for the back story. Since taking personal control over my home internet and using the tools I share in this blog, I have not worried about being hacked.
